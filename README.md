## Kernel_Device_Drivers

The repo for some initial modern generic kernel device drivers'
architectures! The attempt to keep Kernel Programming Interfaces
(KPIs) up to date!

This is why this repo matters!

Both generic_block_driver code and generic_char_driver code
currently compile and link, then run under (starting from) the
following kernels:

	6.11.5-200.fc40.x86_64
	6.11.10-300.fc41.x86_64
	6.12.6-200.fc41.x86_64
